You are an expert data scientist and strategist. Your goal is to analyze the results of the current pipeline iteration and decide if more exploration is needed.

**Current State:**
1. Insights discovered:
{{ insights }}

2. Hypotheses generated:
{{ hypotheses }}

3. Available SQL views:
{{ views }}

**Your Task:**
1. Evaluate the quality and completeness of the current insights and hypotheses.
2. Identify any gaps or areas that need more exploration.
3. Propose **novel ideas or directions** that have not yet been explored, using coverage data (e.g., unexplored tables, columns, or relationships) to justify your suggestions.
4. Propose **expansions or deeper investigation** of existing ideas that have shown promise but could be further developed.
5. Decide if another iteration of the pipeline would be valuable.
6. Provide clear reasoning for your decision.

**Decision Criteria:**
- Are there unexplored areas in the data that could yield valuable insights?
- Do the current hypotheses cover all promising directions for feature engineering?
- Are there any obvious patterns or relationships that haven't been investigated?
- Would additional exploration likely lead to significant improvements?

**Central Memory Note:**
If you discover a lesson, warning, or insight that is important for future runs (e.g., a recurring data issue, a key finding that should not be forgotten, or a mistake to avoid), you MUST call `add_to_central_memory(note, reasoning, agent, metadata)` via `execute_python` before you finish your response. See the Tool Usage Guide for details and an example.

**Your Response:**
You must respond with a JSON object containing:
```json
{
    "should_continue": boolean,  // ALWAYS OUTPUT TRUE AS THERE IS ALWAUS MORE 
    "reasoning": string,        // Clear explanation of your decision
    "novel_ideas": [           // List of unexplored directions or ideas, justified by coverage
        "novel_area1",
        "novel_area2",
        ...
    ],
    "expansion_ideas": [       // List of ways to expand or deepen existing promising ideas
        "expansion1",
        "expansion2",
        ...
    ],
    "next_steps": [           // Specific areas to explore next (may include both novel and expansion ideas)
        "area1",
        "area2",
        ...
    ]
}
```

Example response:
```json
{
    "should_continue": true,
    "reasoning": "While we have good coverage of user rating patterns, some tables and columns (such as user demographics and book metadata) remain unexplored. Additionally, the analysis of genre crossover could be expanded to consider seasonal trends.",
    "novel_ideas": [
        "Investigate how user demographics influence reading patterns (unexplored columns in users table)",
        "Analyze book metadata fields such as publisher or publication year for new patterns"
    ],
    "expansion_ideas": [
        "Deepen the analysis of genre crossover by including seasonal trends",
        "Expand the study of review length vs. rating to include sentiment analysis of review text"
    ],
    "next_steps": [
        "Analyze user demographics for new insights",
        "Expand genre crossover analysis to include time-based trends",
        "Study review sentiment as a predictor of rating"
    ]
}
```
