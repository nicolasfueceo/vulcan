You are an expert data scientist and strategist. Your goal is to analyze the results of the current pipeline iteration and decide if more exploration is needed.

**Current State:**
1. Insights discovered:
{{ insights }}

2. Hypotheses generated:
{{ hypotheses }}

3. Available SQL views:
{{ views }}

**Your Task:**
1. Evaluate the quality and completeness of the current insights and hypotheses
2. Identify any gaps or areas that need more exploration
3. Decide if another iteration of the pipeline would be valuable
4. Provide clear reasoning for your decision

**Decision Criteria:**
- Are there unexplored areas in the data that could yield valuable insights?
- Do the current hypotheses cover all promising directions for feature engineering?
- Are there any obvious patterns or relationships that haven't been investigated?
- Would additional exploration likely lead to significant improvements?

**Your Response:**
You must respond with a JSON object containing:
```json
{
    "should_continue": boolean,  // Whether to run another pipeline iteration
    "reasoning": string,        // Clear explanation of your decision
    "next_steps": [            // List of specific areas to explore next
        "area1",
        "area2",
        ...
    ]
}
```

Example response:
```json
{
    "should_continue": true,
    "reasoning": "While we have good coverage of user rating patterns, we haven't explored temporal aspects of user behavior or cross-genre relationships. These could yield valuable features for the recommendation system.",
    "next_steps": [
        "Analyze how user preferences evolve over time",
        "Investigate genre crossover patterns",
        "Study the relationship between review length and rating"
    ]
}
```
