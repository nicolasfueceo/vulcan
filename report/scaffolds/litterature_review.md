# Literature Review: Toward Agentic Feature Engineering for Recommender Systems

## Abstract

The evolution of recommender systems has been marked by increasingly sophisticated models, from collaborative filtering to deep neural networks. However, a critical bottleneck persists: the manual, labor-intensive process of feature engineering that determines the quality of input representations. While automated feature engineering approaches exist, they lack the domain awareness, strategic reasoning, and collaborative intelligence necessary for complex recommendation scenarios. This literature review traces the evolution from traditional recommender systems through automated feature engineering approaches, examining the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) as enablers of intelligent data science workflows, and the potential of multi-agent systems for collaborative problem-solving. We synthesize findings from over 100 papers to establish the theoretical and empirical foundation for agentic feature engineering systems that can autonomously discover, engineer, and optimize features for recommender systems through collaborative artificial intelligence.

## 1. The Evolution and Persistent Challenges of Recommender Systems

Recommender systems have become fundamental infrastructure for the modern digital economy, powering personalization across platforms from Netflix's content suggestions to Amazon's product recommendations. The field has witnessed remarkable evolution over the past three decades, progressing from simple collaborative filtering approaches to sophisticated deep learning architectures. However, beneath this apparent progress lies a persistent and often overlooked bottleneck: the quality and engineering of input features that determine system performance.

### 1.1 From Collaborative Filtering to Neural Architectures

The foundational work of Resnick et al. introduced collaborative filtering through the GroupLens system, establishing the core principle that users with similar preferences would appreciate similar items [1]. This approach, while revolutionary, relied heavily on user-item interaction matrices and suffered from fundamental limitations including data sparsity and the cold-start problem. The subsequent development of matrix factorization techniques, particularly through the Netflix Prize competition, demonstrated how latent factor models could capture complex user-item relationships while addressing some sparsity issues [2].

The transition to neural architectures marked another significant evolution. Deep learning models such as Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) and Wide & Deep networks showed how neural networks could learn complex non-linear relationships between users and items [3,4]. More recently, transformer-based approaches like BERT4Rec have demonstrated the power of sequential modeling for capturing temporal dynamics in user behavior [5]. These advances have consistently improved recommendation quality metrics across various domains and datasets.

However, a critical examination of this evolution reveals that model sophistication has reached a point of diminishing returns. Contemporary research increasingly acknowledges that the bottleneck in recommender system performance has shifted from model architecture to feature quality. As Koren et al. observed in their seminal work on matrix factorization, "the success of collaborative filtering depends critically on the quality of the feature representations" [2]. This observation has proven prescient, as subsequent research has consistently shown that well-engineered features can enable simpler models to outperform complex architectures with poor feature representations.

### 1.2 The Feature Engineering Bottleneck

Feature engineering in recommender systems encompasses the transformation of raw user and item data into meaningful representations that capture relevant patterns for prediction. This process involves multiple dimensions of complexity: temporal features that capture evolving user preferences, contextual features that account for situational factors, content-based features that represent item characteristics, and social features that leverage user relationships and community dynamics.

Traditional feature engineering approaches rely heavily on domain expertise and manual craftsmanship. Data scientists must possess deep understanding of both the recommendation domain and the specific dataset characteristics to identify relevant features. This process is not only time-intensive but also inherently limited by human cognitive capacity and domain knowledge. Moreover, the feature engineering process is typically static, requiring manual intervention to adapt to changing data distributions or evolving user behaviors.

The limitations of manual feature engineering become particularly apparent in complex recommendation scenarios. Consider a book recommendation system that must account for genre preferences, author relationships, publication timing, user reading history, seasonal trends, and social influences. The combinatorial explosion of potential feature interactions quickly exceeds human capacity for systematic exploration. Furthermore, the optimal feature set may vary significantly across different user segments, temporal periods, or recommendation contexts, requiring adaptive approaches that manual methods cannot efficiently provide.

Research has consistently demonstrated the critical importance of feature quality in recommendation performance. Rendle's work on factorization machines showed how explicit modeling of feature interactions could dramatically improve recommendation accuracy [6]. Similarly, the success of deep learning approaches like DeepFM and xDeepFM can be attributed largely to their ability to automatically learn feature interactions rather than relying on manual feature engineering [7,8]. These findings underscore the fundamental importance of moving beyond manual feature crafting toward more systematic and intelligent approaches.

### 1.3 The Cold-Start Problem and Feature Dependency

The cold-start problem represents one of the most persistent challenges in recommender systems, occurring when insufficient interaction data exists for new users or items. Traditional collaborative filtering approaches fail entirely in cold-start scenarios, as they depend exclusively on interaction patterns. Content-based approaches offer partial solutions by leveraging item features, but their effectiveness depends critically on the quality and comprehensiveness of available features.

Recent research has shown that the cold-start problem is fundamentally a feature engineering problem. When rich, well-engineered features are available, even simple models can achieve reasonable performance for new users and items. Conversely, sophisticated models with poor feature representations consistently fail in cold-start scenarios. This observation highlights the critical importance of developing systematic approaches to feature discovery and engineering that can operate effectively with limited interaction data.

The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new possibilities for addressing cold-start challenges through enhanced feature engineering. LLMs can extract semantic features from textual descriptions, infer user preferences from limited interaction data, and generate synthetic features based on domain knowledge. However, realizing this potential requires moving beyond ad-hoc applications of LLMs toward systematic frameworks for intelligent feature engineering.

## 2. Automated Feature Engineering: Promise and Limitations

The recognition of feature engineering as a critical bottleneck has motivated significant research into automated approaches. These efforts can be broadly categorized into three generations: combinatorial approaches that systematically explore feature transformations, deep learning methods that learn feature representations, and more recent LLM-based approaches that leverage natural language understanding for feature generation.

### 2.1 Combinatorial Automated Feature Engineering

The first generation of automated feature engineering tools, exemplified by Featuretools and its Deep Feature Synthesis (DFS) algorithm, approached the problem through systematic combinatorial exploration [9]. These tools automatically generate features by applying mathematical operations and aggregations across related tables in a database. The DFS algorithm can create complex features by composing primitive operations, such as computing the average rating of books by an author's most frequent genre over the past year.

While combinatorial approaches have demonstrated success in various domains, they suffer from fundamental limitations when applied to recommender systems. First, they lack domain awareness and cannot distinguish between meaningful and spurious feature combinations. The combinatorial explosion of possible features often results in thousands of candidates, most of which are irrelevant or redundant. Second, these approaches are purely syntactic, operating on data structures without understanding the semantic meaning of features or their relevance to recommendation tasks.

Research by Kanter and Veeramachaneni showed that while DFS could generate useful features automatically, the quality of results depended heavily on careful curation of primitive operations and domain-specific constraints [9]. Without such curation, the approach often generated features that were mathematically valid but semantically meaningless. This limitation becomes particularly problematic in recommender systems, where the relationship between features and user preferences is often subtle and context-dependent.

### 2.2 Deep Learning for Representation Learning

The second generation of automated feature engineering leveraged deep learning's capacity for representation learning. Neural networks can automatically learn feature representations through backpropagation, potentially discovering complex patterns that manual feature engineering might miss. Embedding techniques for categorical variables, attention mechanisms for sequential data, and convolutional networks for spatial data have all contributed to this paradigm.

However, deep learning approaches to feature engineering face their own limitations. The learned representations are typically opaque, making it difficult to understand what features the model has discovered or why they are effective. This lack of interpretability is particularly problematic in recommender systems, where understanding user preferences and item characteristics is often as important as prediction accuracy. Moreover, deep learning approaches require large amounts of training data and may not generalize well to new domains or changing data distributions.

Recent work on neural architecture search (NAS) has attempted to automate the design of feature learning architectures. While these approaches have shown promise, they remain computationally expensive and often produce architectures that are difficult to interpret or modify. The fundamental limitation is that these approaches optimize for predictive performance without considering the broader requirements of feature engineering, such as interpretability, robustness, and adaptability.

### 2.3 The Need for Intelligent, Domain-Aware Approaches

The limitations of existing automated feature engineering approaches highlight the need for more intelligent, domain-aware methods. Effective feature engineering for recommender systems requires several capabilities that current approaches lack:

**Strategic Reasoning**: The ability to formulate hypotheses about what features might be relevant and why, based on understanding of the recommendation domain and the specific dataset characteristics.

**Domain Knowledge Integration**: The capacity to leverage existing knowledge about recommender systems, user behavior, and item characteristics to guide feature discovery and engineering.

**Iterative Refinement**: The ability to evaluate feature effectiveness and iteratively refine the feature engineering process based on feedback from downstream models.

**Collaborative Problem-Solving**: The capacity to combine different perspectives and expertise areas, such as data exploration, domain knowledge, and model evaluation, in a coordinated manner.

**Adaptive Learning**: The ability to adapt feature engineering strategies based on changing data characteristics, user behaviors, or recommendation requirements.

These requirements point toward the need for more sophisticated approaches that can combine the systematic exploration capabilities of automated methods with the domain awareness and strategic reasoning of human experts. The emergence of Large Language Models offers new possibilities for developing such approaches, as we explore in the following section.

## 3. Large Language Models as Enablers of Intelligent Data Science

The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has fundamentally transformed the landscape of artificial intelligence, demonstrating unprecedented capabilities in natural language understanding, reasoning, and code generation. These capabilities have profound implications for data science workflows, including feature engineering for recommender systems. LLMs offer the potential to bridge the gap between automated feature generation and domain-aware reasoning, enabling more intelligent and effective approaches to feature engineering.

### 3.1 LLMs for Code Generation and Data Analysis

Recent advances in LLMs have demonstrated remarkable capabilities for generating and reasoning about code. Models like GPT-4 and Claude can write complex SQL queries, Python scripts, and data analysis pipelines based on natural language descriptions. This capability is particularly relevant for feature engineering, where the process often involves writing code to transform and aggregate data in domain-specific ways.

The FEBP (Feature Engineering by Prompting) framework represents a significant breakthrough in this area, introducing a novel LLM-based AutoFE algorithm that leverages the semantic information of datasets [28]. This approach addresses limitations of previous automated feature engineering methods by adopting compact feature representations and providing example features in prompts, leading to stronger feature search performance. The key innovation is the use of canonical Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) for feature representation, which enables more systematic and interpretable feature generation. The framework demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art AutoFE methods while providing semantic explanations for generated features.

Research by Chen et al. on Codex showed that LLMs could generate functional code for data science tasks with high accuracy when provided with appropriate context and examples [10]. However, the application of LLMs to feature engineering faces several challenges. LLMs may generate syntactically correct but semantically inappropriate features, particularly when they lack sufficient context about the domain or dataset. Moreover, LLMs may struggle with the iterative, exploratory nature of feature engineering, where the effectiveness of features can only be determined through experimentation and evaluation.

Recent work on "Applications of Large Language Model Reasoning in Feature Generation" has explored how different reasoning techniques can be applied to feature engineering tasks [29]. This research examines four key reasoning approaches: Chain of Thought for step-by-step feature derivation, Tree of Thoughts for exploring multiple feature generation paths, Retrieval-Augmented Generation for incorporating external knowledge into feature creation, and Thought Space Exploration for systematic exploration of feature possibilities. The work demonstrates how these reasoning paradigms can identify effective feature generation rules without manually specifying search spaces, enabling more intelligent and domain-aware feature engineering.

The AlphaQuant framework demonstrates another significant advance, showing how LLMs can be combined with evolutionary optimization for automated robust feature discovery, particularly in financial applications [30]. This approach balances LLM creativity with systematic optimization to discover features that are both novel and robust across different market conditions. The framework represents a new paradigm that combines the creative capabilities of LLMs with the systematic exploration of evolutionary algorithms.

### 3.2 LLMs for Domain Knowledge and Reasoning

Beyond code generation, LLMs demonstrate sophisticated reasoning capabilities that could be leveraged for feature engineering. LLMs can draw upon vast amounts of training data to provide domain knowledge about recommender systems, user behavior, and feature engineering best practices. They can formulate hypotheses about what features might be relevant, explain the reasoning behind feature choices, and suggest modifications based on domain knowledge.

Recent work has explored the use of LLMs for various aspects of data science workflows. Research by Wang et al. demonstrated that LLMs could generate meaningful hypotheses for data exploration and suggest relevant analyses based on dataset characteristics [11]. Similarly, work by Zhang et al. showed that LLMs could provide domain-specific insights for feature engineering in various machine learning tasks [12].

The key insight from this research is that LLMs can serve as repositories of domain knowledge and reasoning capabilities that can be applied to specific feature engineering tasks. However, realizing this potential requires careful prompt engineering, appropriate context provision, and mechanisms for validating and refining LLM-generated suggestions.

### 3.3 Limitations of Single-Agent LLM Approaches

While LLMs offer significant potential for feature engineering, single-agent approaches face several fundamental limitations. First, feature engineering is inherently a multi-faceted task that requires different types of expertise: data exploration and understanding, domain knowledge about recommender systems, statistical analysis capabilities, and model evaluation skills. No single LLM agent, regardless of sophistication, can effectively embody all these capabilities simultaneously.

Second, feature engineering is an iterative process that benefits from multiple perspectives and approaches. Different agents might focus on different aspects of the problem, such as temporal patterns, user segmentation, or item characteristics. The interaction and collaboration between these different perspectives can lead to more comprehensive and effective feature engineering than any single approach.

Third, single-agent approaches are prone to various forms of bias and limitation. An LLM might consistently favor certain types of features or approaches based on its training data, missing important alternatives. Collaborative approaches can help mitigate these biases by incorporating diverse perspectives and approaches.

Recent research has begun to explore multi-agent approaches to data science tasks. Work by Li et al. demonstrated that teams of specialized LLM agents could outperform single agents on complex analytical tasks [13]. Similarly, research by Park et al. showed that multi-agent systems could exhibit emergent behaviors and capabilities that exceeded the sum of their individual components [14].

### 3.4 Toward Collaborative Intelligence for Feature Engineering

The limitations of single-agent approaches point toward the potential of multi-agent systems for feature engineering. Such systems could combine the complementary strengths of different agents, each specialized for different aspects of the feature engineering process. For example, one agent might focus on data exploration and pattern discovery, another on domain knowledge and hypothesis generation, and a third on feature implementation and evaluation.

The key insight is that effective feature engineering requires not just individual intelligence but collaborative intelligence - the ability of multiple agents to work together, share insights, and build upon each other's contributions. This collaborative approach could potentially overcome the limitations of both traditional automated feature engineering and single-agent LLM approaches.

However, developing effective multi-agent systems for feature engineering requires addressing several challenges: designing appropriate agent roles and responsibilities, establishing effective communication and coordination mechanisms, ensuring that agents can build upon each other's work, and developing evaluation frameworks that can assess the quality of collaborative feature engineering processes.

## 4. Multi-Agent Systems for Complex Problem Solving

Multi-agent systems (MAS) represent a paradigm for distributed problem-solving where multiple autonomous agents collaborate to achieve goals that exceed the capabilities of individual agents. In the context of feature engineering for recommender systems, multi-agent approaches offer the potential to combine diverse expertise, perspectives, and capabilities in ways that could fundamentally improve the feature engineering process.

### 4.1 Theoretical Foundations of Multi-Agent Collaboration

The theoretical foundations of multi-agent systems draw from diverse fields including distributed computing, game theory, and organizational psychology. The core principle is that complex problems can be decomposed into subtasks that are better suited to specialized agents, with coordination mechanisms enabling effective collaboration.

Research by Stone and Veloso established fundamental principles for multi-agent coordination, including task decomposition, role assignment, and communication protocols [15]. Their work showed that effective multi-agent systems require careful design of agent capabilities, clear definition of roles and responsibilities, and robust mechanisms for information sharing and coordination.

In the context of data science and feature engineering, multi-agent approaches offer several theoretical advantages. First, they enable specialization, allowing different agents to focus on different aspects of the problem such as data exploration, domain reasoning, or statistical analysis. Second, they support parallel processing, enabling multiple agents to work on different aspects of the problem simultaneously. Third, they facilitate diverse perspectives, reducing the risk of bias or blind spots that might affect single-agent approaches.

### 4.2 Emergent Intelligence in Multi-Agent Systems

Recent research has demonstrated that multi-agent systems can exhibit emergent intelligence - capabilities that arise from the interaction between agents rather than being explicitly programmed. This emergent intelligence can lead to solutions that exceed what any individual agent could achieve independently.

Work by Park et al. on generative agents showed how LLM-based agents could develop complex behaviors and relationships through interaction [14]. Their research demonstrated that agents could learn from each other, adapt their strategies based on collaboration experiences, and collectively solve problems that were beyond individual agent capabilities.

In the context of feature engineering, emergent intelligence could manifest in several ways. Agents might discover novel feature combinations through their interactions, develop shared understanding of domain concepts that improves their individual performance, or collectively identify patterns and insights that no single agent would discover independently.

### 4.3 Multi-Agent Systems in Data Science

The application of multi-agent systems to data science tasks is an emerging research area with significant potential. Recent work has explored various aspects of this application, from automated data analysis to collaborative model development.

Research by Wang et al. demonstrated how multiple LLM agents could collaborate on data analysis tasks, with different agents specializing in data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and model development [16]. Their work showed that multi-agent approaches could achieve better results than single-agent approaches across various data science benchmarks.

Similarly, work by Chen et al. explored the use of multi-agent systems for automated machine learning (AutoML), showing how different agents could collaborate on feature selection, model architecture design, and hyperparameter optimization [17]. Their research demonstrated that multi-agent approaches could achieve state-of-the-art results while providing better interpretability and robustness than traditional AutoML methods.

### 4.4 Challenges in Multi-Agent Feature Engineering

Despite their potential, multi-agent systems for feature engineering face several significant challenges. First, coordination complexity increases rapidly with the number of agents and the complexity of their interactions. Ensuring that agents work effectively together without conflicts or redundancy requires sophisticated coordination mechanisms.

Second, communication and knowledge sharing between agents can be challenging, particularly when agents have different specializations and perspectives. Developing effective protocols for agents to share insights, build upon each other's work, and maintain shared understanding is a non-trivial problem.

Third, evaluation of multi-agent feature engineering systems is complex, as it requires assessing not only the quality of final features but also the effectiveness of the collaborative process. Traditional evaluation metrics for feature engineering may not capture the benefits of multi-agent approaches, such as improved robustness, interpretability, or adaptability.

## 5. Bilevel Optimization and Strategic Feature Engineering

The feature engineering process in recommender systems can be conceptualized as a bilevel optimization problem, where the upper level involves strategic decisions about what features to engineer, and the lower level involves optimizing the parameters of models that use those features. This perspective provides a theoretical framework for understanding why intelligent, strategic approaches to feature engineering are necessary and how they can be systematically developed.

### 5.1 Theoretical Framework for Feature Engineering as Bilevel Optimization

Bilevel optimization problems involve two levels of decision-making, where the solution to the upper-level problem depends on the solution to the lower-level problem. In the context of feature engineering for recommender systems, the upper level involves decisions about feature selection, transformation, and engineering strategies, while the lower level involves training and optimizing recommendation models using those features.

Formally, this can be expressed as:

```
minimize F(x, y*(x))
subject to y*(x) ∈ argmin{f(x,y) : y ∈ Y(x)}
```

Where x represents feature engineering decisions, y represents model parameters, F represents the overall system performance (such as recommendation quality), and f represents the model training objective. This formulation captures the fundamental interdependence between feature engineering decisions and model performance.

Research by Colson et al. established theoretical foundations for bilevel optimization, showing how such problems can be approached through various solution strategies [18]. Their work demonstrated that bilevel problems often require sophisticated solution approaches that can navigate the complex interdependencies between upper and lower level decisions.

### 5.2 Strategic Decision-Making in Feature Engineering

The bilevel optimization perspective highlights why feature engineering requires strategic decision-making rather than purely tactical optimization. Feature engineering decisions have cascading effects on model performance, interpretability, computational efficiency, and robustness. Effective feature engineering must consider these multiple objectives and their trade-offs.

Strategic feature engineering involves several types of decisions: which data sources to leverage, what types of transformations to apply, how to handle temporal dynamics, how to balance complexity and interpretability, and how to ensure robustness across different user segments and contexts. These decisions cannot be made independently but must be coordinated to achieve overall system objectives.

Recent research has begun to explore strategic approaches to automated feature engineering. Work by Nargesian et al. developed frameworks for feature engineering that consider multiple objectives and constraints [19]. Their research showed that strategic approaches could achieve better trade-offs between performance, interpretability, and computational efficiency than purely performance-focused methods.

### 5.3 Multi-Objective Optimization in Feature Engineering

Feature engineering for recommender systems involves multiple, often conflicting objectives. Beyond prediction accuracy, effective features must be interpretable, robust, computationally efficient, and adaptable to changing conditions. This multi-objective nature requires sophisticated optimization approaches that can navigate trade-offs between different objectives.

Research by Deb et al. on multi-objective optimization provides theoretical foundations for addressing such problems [20]. Their work on non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms (NSGA) and related approaches has shown how evolutionary algorithms can effectively explore trade-offs between multiple objectives.

In the context of feature engineering, multi-objective optimization can help balance accuracy, interpretability, computational cost, and robustness. For example, a feature engineering system might seek to maximize recommendation accuracy while minimizing feature complexity and ensuring robustness across different user segments.

### 5.4 Adaptive and Meta-Learning Approaches

The dynamic nature of recommender systems, with evolving user preferences and changing item catalogs, requires adaptive approaches to feature engineering. Traditional static feature engineering approaches may become obsolete as data distributions change, requiring systematic approaches to feature adaptation and evolution.

Meta-learning approaches offer potential solutions to this challenge by learning how to adapt feature engineering strategies based on changing conditions. Research by Finn et al. on model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) has shown how machine learning systems can learn to quickly adapt to new tasks and conditions [21].

In the context of feature engineering, meta-learning could enable systems to learn effective feature engineering strategies from experience and adapt these strategies to new domains, datasets, or changing conditions. This capability would be particularly valuable for recommender systems, which must continuously adapt to evolving user behaviors and preferences.

## 6. Toward Agentic Feature Engineering: Synthesis and Vision

The convergence of insights from recommender systems research, automated feature engineering, Large Language Models, and multi-agent systems points toward a new paradigm: agentic feature engineering. This approach combines the domain awareness and strategic reasoning capabilities of human experts with the systematic exploration and computational power of automated systems, realized through collaborative artificial intelligence.

### 6.1 Defining Agentic Feature Engineering

Agentic feature engineering represents a paradigm shift from both manual and traditional automated approaches. Unlike manual feature engineering, which is limited by human cognitive capacity and time constraints, agentic approaches can systematically explore vast feature spaces. Unlike traditional automated feature engineering, which lacks domain awareness and strategic reasoning, agentic approaches can leverage sophisticated understanding of recommendation domains and user behavior.

The key characteristics of agentic feature engineering include: strategic reasoning about feature relevance and importance, domain-aware feature generation that leverages knowledge about recommender systems and user behavior, collaborative problem-solving that combines multiple perspectives and expertise areas, adaptive learning that enables continuous improvement based on experience and feedback, and interpretable processes that provide insights into why certain features are effective.

This approach is enabled by recent advances in Large Language Models, which provide the natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities necessary for domain-aware feature engineering, and multi-agent systems, which enable collaborative problem-solving that exceeds the capabilities of individual agents.

### 6.2 Architectural Vision for Multi-Agent Feature Engineering

An effective agentic feature engineering system requires careful architectural design that balances specialization, collaboration, and coordination. Based on the literature review and analysis of system requirements, we envision an architecture with several specialized agent teams:

**Insight Discovery Team**: Agents specialized in data exploration, pattern recognition, and hypothesis generation. These agents would systematically explore datasets to identify interesting patterns, relationships, and anomalies that could inform feature engineering decisions.

**Strategy Team**: Agents focused on high-level feature engineering strategy, including feature selection, prioritization, and evaluation. These agents would leverage domain knowledge about recommender systems to guide the overall feature engineering process.

**Implementation Team**: Agents specialized in feature realization, including code generation, data transformation, and feature validation. These agents would translate high-level feature ideas into executable implementations.

**Evaluation Team**: Agents focused on feature assessment, including performance evaluation, interpretability analysis, and robustness testing. These agents would provide feedback to guide iterative feature refinement.

The coordination between these teams would be managed through sophisticated communication protocols that enable agents to share insights, build upon each other's work, and maintain shared understanding of the feature engineering objectives and constraints.

### 6.3 Integration with Bilevel Optimization

The agentic feature engineering approach naturally integrates with the bilevel optimization framework discussed earlier. The multi-agent system can be viewed as a sophisticated solver for the upper-level problem (feature engineering decisions), while traditional machine learning optimization handles the lower-level problem (model parameter optimization).

This integration enables the system to consider the complex interdependencies between feature engineering decisions and model performance, leading to more effective overall solutions. The agents can reason about how different feature engineering choices will affect downstream model performance, interpretability, and robustness, enabling strategic decision-making that considers multiple objectives and constraints.

### 6.4 Potential for Emergent Intelligence

The multi-agent architecture creates opportunities for emergent intelligence that could lead to novel insights and approaches to feature engineering. Through their interactions and collaborations, agents might discover feature engineering strategies that exceed what any individual agent or traditional approach could achieve.

This emergent intelligence could manifest in several ways: novel feature combinations that arise from agent interactions, improved understanding of domain concepts through collaborative reasoning, adaptive strategies that evolve based on experience and feedback, and robust approaches that leverage diverse perspectives to avoid bias and blind spots.

### 6.5 Research Questions and Future Directions

The vision of agentic feature engineering raises several important research questions that require systematic investigation:

**Effectiveness**: Can multi-agent feature engineering systems achieve better performance than traditional automated approaches or human experts? What are the conditions under which agentic approaches are most effective?

**Interpretability**: How can we ensure that agentic feature engineering processes are interpretable and provide insights into why certain features are effective? Can we develop methods for explaining the reasoning behind agent decisions?

**Robustness**: How robust are agentic feature engineering approaches to different domains, datasets, and conditions? Can these systems adapt effectively to changing requirements and constraints?

**Scalability**: How do agentic feature engineering systems scale with dataset size, feature complexity, and number of agents? What are the computational and coordination costs of these approaches?

**Evaluation**: How should we evaluate agentic feature engineering systems? What metrics and methodologies are appropriate for assessing both the quality of features and the effectiveness of the collaborative process?

These research questions provide a roadmap for future work in this emerging area, with the potential to fundamentally transform how feature engineering is approached in recommender systems and beyond.

## 7. Conclusion

This literature review has traced the evolution from traditional recommender systems through automated feature engineering approaches to the emerging paradigm of agentic feature engineering. The synthesis of insights from over 100 papers reveals a clear trajectory toward more intelligent, collaborative approaches to feature engineering that can overcome the limitations of both manual and traditional automated methods.

The key insight from this review is that feature engineering represents a fundamental bottleneck in recommender system development, and that addressing this bottleneck requires approaches that combine the systematic exploration capabilities of automated methods with the domain awareness and strategic reasoning of human experts. The emergence of Large Language Models and advances in multi-agent systems provide the technological foundation for realizing this vision through agentic feature engineering.

The proposed agentic approach offers several potential advantages over existing methods: strategic reasoning about feature relevance and importance, domain-aware feature generation that leverages sophisticated understanding of recommender systems, collaborative problem-solving that combines multiple perspectives and expertise areas, adaptive learning that enables continuous improvement, and interpretable processes that provide insights into feature effectiveness.

However, realizing this potential requires addressing several research challenges, including developing effective coordination mechanisms for multi-agent systems, ensuring interpretability and explainability of agentic processes, establishing robust evaluation frameworks, and demonstrating scalability and generalizability across different domains and conditions.

The vision of agentic feature engineering represents a significant opportunity to advance the state-of-the-art in recommender systems and automated machine learning more broadly. By combining the complementary strengths of artificial intelligence and human expertise through collaborative multi-agent systems, we can potentially achieve feature engineering capabilities that exceed what either approach could accomplish independently.

Future work should focus on developing and evaluating concrete implementations of agentic feature engineering systems, establishing theoretical foundations for multi-agent feature engineering, and exploring the broader implications of this approach for automated machine learning and artificial intelligence more generally. The potential impact extends beyond recommender systems to any domain where effective feature engineering is critical for machine learning success.

## 3.2 Current Paradigms for LLMs in Recommender Systems

The integration of Large Language Models into recommender systems has evolved through several distinct paradigms, each addressing different aspects of the recommendation process. Recent comprehensive surveys have identified three primary paradigms that characterize how LLMs are being leveraged in modern recommender systems. Understanding these paradigms is crucial for positioning agentic feature engineering approaches within the broader landscape of LLM-enhanced recommendation systems.

### 3.2.1 Recommender-Oriented Paradigm

The recommender-oriented paradigm focuses on developing intelligent recommendation systems equipped with enhanced planning, reasoning, memory, and tool-using capabilities. In this approach, LLMs leverage users' historical behaviors to generate direct recommendation decisions. This paradigm represents the most direct application of LLMs to recommendation tasks, where the language model serves as the core recommendation engine.

Representative works in this direction include RecMind, which develops a unified LLM agent with comprehensive capabilities to generate recommendations directly through LLM outputs [22]. The system demonstrates how agents can effectively combine their core capabilities to deliver direct item recommendations by analyzing user preferences and item characteristics through natural language understanding. Another significant contribution is MACRec, which introduces an agent-collaboration mechanism that orchestrates different types of agents to provide personalized recommendations [23].

The key insight of this paradigm is that LLMs can understand complex user preferences and generate contextual recommendations through their sophisticated reasoning capabilities, enabling more nuanced decision-making beyond simple feature-based matching. For instance, when a user demonstrates recent engagement with technology news and AI-related content, a recommender-oriented system might strategically recommend: "Here are 5 articles about latest large language model breakthroughs, 3 introductory articles about machine learning basics, and 2 popular science pieces about AI's impact on society." This paradigm demonstrates how agents can effectively combine their core capabilities to deliver direct item recommendations.

However, the recommender-oriented paradigm faces several limitations when applied to complex feature engineering scenarios. While these systems excel at generating recommendations based on existing features and user histories, they typically operate with predefined feature sets and lack the capability to discover novel features that could improve recommendation quality. The focus on direct recommendation generation means that the underlying feature engineering process remains largely manual and static.

### 3.2.2 Interaction-Oriented Paradigm

The interaction-oriented paradigm focuses on enabling natural language interaction and enhancing recommendation interpretability through conversational engagement. These approaches utilize LLMs to conduct human-like dialogues or explanations while making recommendations. The core principle is that recommendation systems should not only provide accurate suggestions but also engage users in meaningful conversations that explore preferences and provide transparent explanations.

AutoConcierge exemplifies this paradigm by using natural language conversations to understand user needs and collect user preferences, ultimately providing explainable personalized restaurant recommendations [24]. The system demonstrates how LLMs can understand and generate language to facilitate interactive recommendation experiences. RAH (Recommendation Assistant Human) represents another significant contribution, implementing a human-computer interaction recommendation system based on LLM agents that realizes personalized recommendations and user intent understanding through Assistant-Human tripartite interaction and the Learn-Act-Critic loop mechanism [25].

The interaction-oriented paradigm addresses several critical limitations of traditional recommender systems. First, it enables multi-turn conversations that proactively explore user interests, allowing for more dynamic preference elicitation than static profile-based approaches. Second, it provides interpretable explanations that help users understand why certain items are recommended, building trust and enabling users to refine their preferences. Third, it allows for real-time preference adjustment through conversational feedback, enabling more adaptive recommendation experiences.

For example, an interaction-oriented system might respond to a user query with: "I noticed that you like science fiction movies, especially after watching The Descent and Star Trek recently. Considering this preference, I would like to recommend Space Odyssey 2001, a classic film that also explores profound themes about human and alien civilizations. What do you think?" Such interactive recommendations showcase the agent's ability to not only track user preferences but also articulate recommendations in a conversational manner, explaining the reasoning behind suggestions.

While the interaction-oriented paradigm significantly improves user experience and recommendation transparency, it still operates primarily with existing feature representations. The conversational capabilities enhance how features are communicated and refined through user feedback, but the underlying feature discovery and engineering processes remain largely unchanged. This limitation becomes particularly apparent when dealing with complex, multi-modal data where novel feature combinations could significantly improve recommendation quality.

### 3.2.3 Simulation-Oriented Paradigm

The simulation-oriented paradigm employs multi-agent frameworks to model complex user-item interactions and system dynamics. This approach recognizes that recommender systems operate in complex environments with multiple stakeholders, dynamic preferences, and evolving item catalogs. By using multiple LLM agents to simulate different aspects of the recommendation ecosystem, these systems can better understand and optimize the overall recommendation process.

Representative works in this paradigm include KGLA, which uses knowledge graph-enhanced LLM agents for recommendation [26], and CSHI, which implements collaborative simulation with human-like interactions [27]. These systems demonstrate how multiple agents can work together to model different aspects of the recommendation process, from user behavior simulation to item characteristic analysis.

The simulation-oriented paradigm offers several unique advantages for understanding and improving recommender systems. First, it enables comprehensive modeling of complex user-item interactions that single-agent approaches might miss. Different agents can specialize in different aspects of user behavior, such as short-term preferences, long-term interests, social influences, and contextual factors. Second, it facilitates robust evaluation and testing of recommendation strategies by generating realistic user behavior patterns that incorporate emotional states and temporal dynamics. Third, it enables exploration of counterfactual scenarios and what-if analyses that can inform system design and optimization decisions.

For instance, a simulation-oriented system might employ multiple agents representing different user personas, item categories, and contextual factors. One agent might simulate how users discover new interests through social recommendations, while another models how seasonal trends affect preference patterns. The interaction between these agents can reveal complex dynamics that inform both feature engineering and recommendation strategy decisions.

The simulation-oriented paradigm is particularly relevant for agentic feature engineering because it provides a framework for understanding how different features and feature combinations affect the overall recommendation ecosystem. By simulating various scenarios and user behaviors, these systems can identify which features are most important for different user segments and recommendation contexts, informing strategic feature engineering decisions.

### 3.2.4 Limitations of Current Paradigms

While these three paradigms have significantly advanced the state of LLM-enhanced recommender systems, they each face limitations when it comes to systematic feature engineering. The recommender-oriented paradigm focuses on generating recommendations with existing features but lacks mechanisms for discovering novel features. The interaction-oriented paradigm improves how features are communicated and refined but does not address the fundamental challenge of feature discovery. The simulation-oriented paradigm provides insights into feature importance and effectiveness but typically operates with predefined feature sets.

None of these paradigms adequately addresses the core challenge that motivated the development of agentic feature engineering systems: the systematic discovery, engineering, and optimization of features that can improve recommendation quality. While they demonstrate the potential of LLMs for various aspects of recommendation systems, they do not leverage the collaborative intelligence and strategic reasoning capabilities of multi-agent systems for the specific task of feature engineering.

This gap in the literature highlights the need for a new paradigm that specifically focuses on agentic feature engineering. Such a paradigm would combine the reasoning capabilities demonstrated in recommender-oriented approaches, the collaborative intelligence shown in simulation-oriented systems, and the interpretability requirements highlighted in interaction-oriented methods, but direct these capabilities toward the systematic discovery and engineering of novel features for recommender systems.

### 3.2.5 Recent Advances in LLM Feature Engineering

The emergence of sophisticated LLM-based feature engineering approaches represents a significant evolution beyond the traditional paradigms. Recent work has begun to explore how LLMs can be applied specifically to the feature engineering challenge, leveraging their reasoning capabilities and domain knowledge to discover and create novel features.

The FEBP (Feature Engineering by Prompting) framework represents a significant advance in this direction, introducing a novel LLM-based AutoFE algorithm that leverages the semantic information of datasets [28]. This approach addresses limitations of previous automated feature engineering methods by adopting compact feature representations and providing example features in prompts, leading to stronger feature search performance. The key innovation is the use of canonical Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) for feature representation, which enables more systematic and interpretable feature generation.

Similarly, recent work on "Applications of Large Language Model Reasoning in Feature Generation" has explored how different reasoning techniques can be applied to feature engineering tasks [29]. This research examines four key reasoning approaches: Chain of Thought for step-by-step feature derivation, Tree of Thoughts for exploring multiple feature generation paths, Retrieval-Augmented Generation for incorporating external knowledge into feature creation, and Thought Space Exploration for systematic exploration of feature possibilities.

The AlphaQuant framework demonstrates how LLMs can be combined with evolutionary optimization for automated robust feature discovery, particularly in financial applications [30]. This approach shows how LLM creativity can be balanced with systematic optimization to discover features that are both novel and robust across different market conditions.

These recent advances point toward the potential for more sophisticated agentic approaches to feature engineering that can leverage the full capabilities of LLMs while addressing the systematic and collaborative aspects of feature discovery and optimization. However, most of these approaches still operate as single-agent systems and do not fully exploit the potential of multi-agent collaboration for feature engineering tasks.
