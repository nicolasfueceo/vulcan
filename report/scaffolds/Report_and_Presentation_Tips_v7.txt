Project Assessment

Assessment of Final Year Projects (FYPs) is by
more than one member of staff, and generally
the second assessor is deliberately from another
area of research, or is randomly selected.

Project Assessment
The report must stand on its own, providing a clear
progression into details of experiments from a
broad introduction, gradually honing into the main
contribution of your project (funnel-structure).
In the conclusion and discussion, you can broaden
out again to place the work into context (reverse
funnel).

Figure Guidelines
• Ensure that all figures have large, readable
axis and value labels (text).
• Use consistent colours and font sizes for all
figures.

• Ensure that lines on plots are sufficiently thick.

Examples

Matplotlib examples; these are not good examples, because axes are not labelled!

Several figures combined….
Note the consistency and sizes of
fonts. These are all data generated
figures, so can be
generated programmatically.
Note use of different types of plot
(combined) to provide insight and
analysis.
Clear , readable diagrams; sparsely
added annotations to enhance
Interpretation.
Symbols would be defined in caption.

Figure preparation (flowcharts, etc)
You WILL need to modify figures as you move
from draft to final version of report/thesis;

Therefore, save every figure in an editable
format. NOT PNG, TIFF, JPG etc.

An example of a v. good diagram
Observe:
Without knowing anything about what
the paper is about, the figure and caption
conveys a HUGE amount of information.
Key decision to split into (A) and (B).
“A” sets the context of the paper, and
“B” provides a brief insight into the specific
contribution of this paper.

From Raman et al. https://www.pnas.org/content/116/21/10537

Figure preparation (from experiments)
• You WILL need to modify figures as you move
from draft to final version of report/thesis;
• You have two options:
1. Write separate scripts/programs to generate each
figure;

2. Save every figure in an editable format. NOT PNG,
TIFF, JPG etc.
BICI Lab Tips for Reports

14

Examples of editable formats
Editable means a VECTOR fomat:
• SVG: editable using Inkscape
• PDF (not recommended); sometimes editable via Inkscape
• Something like TIKZ (not that easy…)
• Power Point (not recommended)
• Word (not recommended)

Common error….
• Thinking: “I can’t fit the figures in…”
• Yes you can – in LaTeX, you can use the subcaption or
subfigure environments (choice depends on compatibility).
• Worst case – combine outside of document (usually for final
version).
• For data generated figures, there are programmatic ways of
combining plots:

Don’t just report your “best” result
Include results from different types of network/training
algorithms in tabular form, not just your “final” result.

25

Reporting Experiments
• Give all relevant experimental details. DO NOT
assume audience knows about CIFAR,
Montezuma’s revenge etc.
• More to the point, explain the significance of
using a particular dataset or environment.
Particularly true for robotics stream people.

BICI Lab Tips for Reports

26

Reporting Experiments

Average performance in a test set/in new
environments is only part of the story; it is
important to report on the variability of models.

BICI Lab Tips for Reports

27

Reporting Experiments
Include error bars/bounds for training curves; for
example, compute the standard deviation of
performance as a function of training epochs, add
upper and lower bounds as (say) +/- 1.96 sigma as
data and training partitioning is permuted.

Reporting Experiments

BICI Lab Tips for Reports

29

Reporting Experiments
• Standard deviation of performance can be
computed in different ways, e.g. permuting
training and test data, or starting training with
multiple random seeds at initialisation.
• Permuting training and test data gives some
indication of how repeatable results might be
in other datasets.
BICI Lab Tips for Reports

30

Reporting Experiments

• If you can’t permute data, or are working with
rather restricted environments, use a
collection of several random seeds for weight
initialisation.

BICI Lab Tips for Reports

31

Reporting Experiments
You can also report results of final trained performance –
and its variability – under data permutations or weight seed
initialisation using tables. Note the format of mean (s.d.) below,
but you can also use +/- notation.

BICI Lab Tips for Reports

32

Reporting Experiments
For the formatting of tables, see
https://inf.ethz.ch/personal/markusp/teaching/guid
es/guide-tables.pdf
The LaTeX package “booktabs” has several useful
constructs for good table formatting.
Like figures, captions are not optional – they should
be descriptive, and highlight key messages about
the outcomes we can see from the table.
BICI Lab Tips for Reports

33

Big Hint…

A common problem in reporting work is that the
quantity of work spent on experiments is not
appreciated by assessors.

BICI Lab Tips for Reports

34

Big Hint…
The solution to this is to “squeeze as much out of your
experiments as possible”.
Tip: even experiments that don’t yield good performance
can be reported. But don’t report performance where
training is not at all happening (e.g. flat training curves).
Tip: many authors will include performance results from
other papers/techniques in the same table, citing papers
where those results are reported (important!).
BICI Lab Tips for Reports

35

Other tips….
• Equations: by all means, use them. A balance to
equations and text is key to having a readable
report.
• If you’ve done something “hacky” in coding, write
an equation to express it (could be a novel
contribution).
• You can also express contributions/ideas through
pseudo-code; treat as equations (label, define
inputs/outputs etc) + add captions (like tables).
BICI Lab Tips for Reports

36

Other tips….
• Do a spell-check (of course!) AND a check for
consistency of spelling/hyphenation.
• Punctuation – lots of people get very upset about
bad punctuation. Get feedback from friends.

• Citation style – check for consistency (best
sometimes, online citation entries are
inconsistent)
BICI Lab Tips for Reports

37

Get feedback on your report!!!
• The most common source of “low” marks comes
from not getting feedback EARLY ENOUGH on
reports.

• Provide early drafts – it does not matter if they are
imperfect – you are NOT being assessed in the
feedback phase…..

Presentation Tips
• Plan on 1 minute per slide; 20 m talk, no more
than 20 slides.

• Minimal text on slide. Do not read off things
from slides: that is annoying.

BICI Lab Tips for Reports

40

Speak at the right speed/volume
• Important: if you have a tendency to speak
fast, DON’T…You get this right from rehearsing
the talk before you give it. Often, several
times.
• Speak relatively loudly (you need to practice
this, with friendly feedback): remember, some
people may have hearing problems.
BICI Lab Tips for Reports

41

Presentation Tips
• Do use humour where you can, but keep it
sparse.
• Do acknowledge collaborations etc;
acknowledge sources of funding (PhD/RA
students: if you are supported by a
scholarship, say so on last slide, for example).

BICI Lab Tips for Reports

42

Presentation Tips
• A slide may have several figures (along the lines
of Slide 7 and 8 of this presentation).
• You can spend time explaining carefully each
graph/image on the slide; allow up to 2 minutes
for such slides.
• Do not rush your presentation; instead, have
extra slides to bring up if more details are needed
BICI Lab Tips for Reports

43

Animations
• Highly useful, particularly if you have timevarying images. Just incorporate as movies.

• Check that movies play on the machine you
will give the talk.
• Remember to come up with some spoken
explanation of what people should observe in
the animations.

Wisdom from Maria Petrou
“You can’t just say it: you have to beat them over the head
with it!” [The late Maria Petrou – critiquing one of my grant
applications]
Translation: Spell it out! Don’t assume your audience will
understand what you are showing them in a graph or image.
Point to what you want them to see and say (generalized
example):
“Note how X improves Y according to metric Z”.
BICI Lab Tips for Reports

45

Presentation Tips
• Do not underestimate how important it is to use
the right way of explaining concepts: your
audience will always misinterpret everything!
• The only guard against misinterpretation of your
work/what you say is to get feedback on your
presentation before you present, so you know
how to update slides to disambiguate.
• Remember that technical terminology is often
overloaded (in the coding sense!). Define
everything.
BICI Lab Tips for Reports

46

Avoid, avoid, avoid
• The tendency to “play it cool” and drink water
while you speak.
• Speaking too quietly in an attempt to appear
relaxed (a common issue with tech
presentations). It is deeply irritating to most
people that will be involved in assessing you.

BICI Lab Tips for Reports

47

Rehearse, Rehearse, Rehearse
• Sounds simple, but in order to be able to
rehearse, you cannot leave the slide prep to
the last minute!
• True story: We have rehearsed presentations
with students applying for PhD positions. It
has made the difference!

Assessment of Reports

The slides following this on assessment are OLD;
they were once applicable to reports for MScs
and UGs; but they give a hint of what to look out
for in report/paper writing!

Assessment “criteria”
Note that the
Project Report
carries a significant
amount of weight.

BICI Lab Tips for Reports

50

Assessment “criteria…”
Things to note:
1. First AND second marker give
extensive justification.
2. Clarity of report is vital (avoid
undefined terminology that is
specific to the sub-field).
3. Literature survey == appropriate use
of citations.
4. Conclusions drawn from data ->
in the text AND in table and figure
captions.
