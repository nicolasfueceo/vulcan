All good projects conclude with an objective evaluation of the project's successes and failures and suggestions for future work which can take the project further. It is important to understand that there is no such thing as a perfect project. 

Even the very best pieces of work have their limitations and you are expected to provide a proper critical appraisal of what you have done. Your assessors are bound to spot the limitations of your work and you are expected to be able to do the same.
