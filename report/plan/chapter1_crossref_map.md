# Chapter 1 Cross-Reference Map

This document maps the required content, references, and arguments from the literature review and planning report to each section of Chapter 1. It will be used to ensure full integration and dense citation in the revised thesis introduction.

## 1.1 Motivation
- **Key Arguments:**
  - Societal and economic impact of recommender systems (Netflix, Amazon, etc.)
  - Persistent challenges: cold-start, scrutability, transparency, trust
  - Motivation for interpretable, narrative-driven, and agentic recommenders
- **Citations:**
  - [Resnick et al. 1994], [Koren et al. 2009], [Linden et al. 2003], [Planning_Report.txt: lines 18–45], [litterature_review.md: lines 9–35]
  - Market impact/statistics if available
- **Figures:**
  - Figure 1 from Planning_Report.txt (cold-start framework)

## 1.2 Evolution of Recommender Systems
- **Key Arguments:**
  - Chronological review: collaborative filtering → matrix factorization → deep learning → hybrid/graph/AutoFE → LLMs
  - Each paradigm’s strengths, limitations, and transition drivers
  - Importance of feature engineering bottleneck
- **Citations:**
  - [Resnick et al. 1994], [Linden et al. 2003], [Koren et al. 2009], [He et al. 2017], [Cheng et al. 2016], [Sun et al. 2019], [Kanter & Veeramachaneni 2015], [Planning_Report.txt: lines 202–230], [litterature_review.md: lines 11–35, 39–71]
- **Figures:**
  - Figure 2 from Planning_Report.txt (modern RS pipeline)

## 1.3 Large Language Models (LLMs) in Recommender Systems
- **Key Arguments:**
  - LLM architectures, capabilities, and technical advances
  - LLMs for feature engineering, representation, data augmentation
  - Model selection: fine-tuned vs. frozen LLMs; LLM as foundation vs. augmentation
  - Agentic/multi-agent paradigms and synthetic data generation
- **Citations:**
  - [Wang et al. 2023], [KALM4Rec], [KAR], [U-BERT], [Cao et al.], [Ramos et al.], [Planning_Report.txt: lines 240–348], [litterature_review.md: lines 73–113]
- **Figures:**
  - Figure 3 from Planning_Report.txt (LLM adaptation quadrants)

## 1.4 Problem Statement
- **Key Arguments:**
  - Persistent feature engineering bottleneck despite advances
  - Lack of principled, interpretable, agentic frameworks for feature engineering
  - Need for multi-agent, LLM-powered, collaborative approaches
- **Citations:**
  - [Kanter & Veeramachaneni 2015], [Zou et al. 2025], [Wang et al. 2024], [Planning_Report.txt: lines 229–233], [litterature_review.md: lines 17–71, 98–113]

## 1.5 Contributions
- **Key Arguments:**
  - Agentic feature engineering framework: architecture, agent roles, LLM integration
  - Empirical evaluation, open-source implementation, reproducibility
- **Citations:**
  - [Wang et al. 2024], [Zou et al. 2025], [Planning_Report.txt: implementation plan], [litterature_review.md: lines 196–246]

## 1.6 Thesis Outline
- **Key Arguments:**
  - Logical structure, mapping chapters to research objectives
- **Citations:**
  - Planning_Report.txt outline, thesis guidelines

## Notes
- All references must be verified for BibTeX completeness.
- Figures should be referenced and described in the text.
- Every claim must be supported by at least one citation.
- Use direct quotes or paraphrased insights from both sources where they add value.
