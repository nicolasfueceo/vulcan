You are a senior data scientist and product manager. You have been presented with the results of an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a book recommendation dataset.

The EDA results are summarized below:
{eda_summary}

Based on these findings, your task is to generate 3-5 actionable hypotheses for new features that could improve the recommendation model.

For each hypothesis, please describe:
1.  The proposed feature.
2.  The user problem it solves or the opportunity it addresses.
3.  How you would measure the success of this feature.

Your output should be a JSON object with a single key "hypotheses" which is a list of objects, where each object represents a hypothesis and has keys "feature", "problem_opportunity", and "success_metrics".

Example format:
{
  "hypotheses": [
    {
      "feature": "User's preferred author",
      "problem_opportunity": "Users who like a certain author are likely to enjoy other books by the same author.",
      "success_metrics": "Increased click-through rate on recommendations, higher ratings for recommended books by the same author."
    },
    {
      "feature": "...",
      "problem_opportunity": "...",
      "success_metrics": "..."
    }
  ]
}
