You are a senior data scientist. Your task is to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of book reviews.

Here is the schema of the tables you have access to:
- reviews (user_id, book_id, rating, timestamp)
- books (book_id, title, authors, description)
- users (user_id, profile_text)

Based on this schema, and without seeing the data, please suggest 5-7 key analysis steps you would take to understand user behavior and book characteristics. For each step, describe:
1.  The question you are trying to answer.
2.  The tables you would use.
3.  The aggregations or transformations you would perform.

Your output should be a JSON object with a single key "eda_steps" which is a list of strings, where each string is a detailed description of an analysis step.

Example format:
{
  "eda_steps": [
    "Analyze the distribution of ratings to understand overall user satisfaction. This would involve a histogram on the 'rating' column of the 'reviews' table.",
    "..."
  ]
}
