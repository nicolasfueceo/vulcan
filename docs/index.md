# Welcome to VULCAN

VULCAN is an autonomous multi-agent system for strategic feature engineering in recommender systems. It simulates a team of AI specialists (e.g., DataRepresenter, QuantitativeAnalyst, HypothesisAgent) who collaborate in structured group chats to discover, design, and validate new features for a book recommendation engine.

## Core Hypothesis
By orchestrating specialized agents in a collaborative, self-correcting loop, VULCAN can autonomously generate, optimize, and validate novel features that improve downstream recommender performance.
